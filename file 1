James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991.[22] Java was originally
designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time.[23]
The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by
the name Green and was finally renamed Java,from Java coffee.[24] Gosling designed Java with
a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.
